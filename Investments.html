      In this page we will be introducing ourselves to investing, the type of investments, stocks, funds, and real estate investing.<br>
      <b>What is investing?</b><br>
      What is investing? Investing involves allocating funds with
      the aim of generating future returns; however, it entails risk
      yet it also offers the potential for substantial rewards.
      The Types of Investments include stocks, bonds, mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETF).<br>

      <b>What are Stocks?</b><br>
      Stocks represent ownership shares in a company, signifying partial ownership.
      Acquiring stocks equates to obtaining a fractional stake in the company's ownership.
      Stock prices fluctuate in response to the company's performance and market dynamics.<br>

      <b>What are bonds?</b><br>
      Bonds are loans that you make to a company or government. In return, the
      company or government agrees to pay you interest on the loan and return your
      money at a certain date. Bonds are considered to be less risky than stocks,
      but they also offer lower returns.<br>

      <b>What are funds?</b><br>
      There are three types of funds:
      <ul>
        <li>Mutual Funds</li>
        <li>Exchange Traded Funds (ETF)</li>
        <li>Index Funds</li>
      </ul>
      A mutual fund is an investment fund that pools money from many investors to purchase securities. ETFs are similar to mutual funds but trade on exchanges like stock.
      Index Funds are also a type of Mutual Funds however they purchase a collection of securities that mirror the constituents of a specific index.
      For example, an S&P 500 index fund would acquire shares of all 500 companies listed in the S&P 500 index. There are advantages and disadvantages to investing in the
      different types of funds. If you want to know more about which fund to invest in, it is advised to seek a trusted financial advisor.<br>

      <b>What is real estate investing?</b><br>
      Real estate investing involves the purchase, management and sale or rental of real estate for profit. It is important to do research before investing
      in real estate.

      If you do plan on investing it is important to remember to diversify investments, set goals, take into account investment time, pick who manages your investments,
      do taxes on gains, monitor investments, risk tolerance, fees, stay disciplined. It is also of interest to consider professional advice from a
      financial advisor when investing.
