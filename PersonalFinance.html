      The start to good personal finance is financial goals. These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.<br>
      By budgeting you will help achieve your financial goals and know what you can and cannot spend.<br>
      Credit is also very important towards personal finance. Because Credit allows borrowing and gradual repayment. Good credit also aids with loaning with better rates. By being responsible and making your credit payments on time will allow for good credit.<br>
      Usually financial goals are ones geared towards saving money. Saving is very important and usually acts as a safety blanket towards time of emergencies.<br>
      A good way of gaining wealth is by investing. Investing includdes many things with stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc. however make sure to always research before investing or ask a financial advisor.<br>
      Ways to protect your assets are insurance, estate, and retirement planning. These protections would allow for help during times of emergencies just like savings would.
