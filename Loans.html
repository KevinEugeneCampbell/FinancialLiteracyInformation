        <b>What are Loans? How do you apply for it?</b><br>
        A loan is a trasnfer of money by one party to another with an agreement to pay it back. The borrower usually incurs a debt and is usually required to pay interest for the use of the money.
        To apply for a loan you will need to provide the lender with information about your
        income, assets, and debt. The lender will then use this info to assess your eligibility for the loan and what interest rate should be charged.
        Before you sign any loan documents, it is important to understand the terms of the
        loan, including the interest rate, repayment period, and fees. <br>

        <b>What is an Amortization Schedule?</b><br>
        It is a table that shows how much of your monthly loan payment goes
        towards principal and interest, and how much of the loan you will
        have paid off over time. It is a useful tool for understanding how a
        loan works and for budgeting your monthly payments. The things included in a Amortization schedule include:
        loan amount, interest rate, number of payments, monthly payment, principal paid each month, interest paid each month and remaining balance.
