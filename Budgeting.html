      When calculating your budget you will need to calculate your Disposable Income then you will have to make a list of needs and wants with the appropriate prices for each item in the list. Using the amount you need to spend, subtract the total amount from your  needs from your Dispoable Income. You also need to take into account how much you want to save per month and anything left over can be used on your wants, if you want.
