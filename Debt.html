    <p>
      In this page you will be leaning the basics of debt, managing debt, and the benefits of escaping debt.<br>
      <b>What is debt?</b><br>
      Debt is a financial obligation to a person or party that owes money to another. Usually debt occurs from loans or credit cards.
      However not all debt is bad. If you use the loan to increase income or assets and payback the loan eventually then it is good.
      There are five main type of debts:
      <ul>
        <li>Student loan(s) debt</li>
        <li>Mortgage(s) debt</li>
        <li>Auto loan(s) debt</li>
        <li>Credit card debt</li>
        <li>Personal loan(s) debt</li>
      </ul>
      If you cannot manage your debt properly you will lead into many financial problems which can include bankruptcy.
      Moreover, it can also lead to a damaged credit score and damaged creditworthiness. But if you do manage it well and pay off your debt,
      you will feel less burdened because you are financially free without a damaged credit score.

      There is simple 7 tips to help with managing debt:
      <ul>
        <li>Creating a budget</li>
        <li>Paying more than minimum</li>
        <li>Consolidating multiple debts into one loan</li>
        <li>Getting assisstance from a credit counselor</li>
        <li>Set realistic goals</li>
        <li>Avoid using credit cards for unnecessary purchases</li>
        <li>Do not take out more debt than you can afford monthly</li>
      </ul>

      If you failed with managing with debt and it is spiraling out of control you will have to declare bankruptcy.
      Bankruptcy is a legal process which helps you eliminate debt, however it has severe consequences on your credit score and creditworthiness.
      Before declaring bankruptcy speaking with an attorney is a must to understand your options.
