      <b>What is credit score?</b><br>

      The higher score you posess the higher your creditworthiness. Here are the general credit score ranges:
      <ul>
        <li>800-850: Excellent Credit Score</li>
        <li>740-799: Very Good Credit Score</li>
        <li>670-739: Good Credit Score</li>
        <li>580-669: Fair Credit Score</li>
        <li>300-579: Poor Credit Score</li>
      </ul>

      <b>What are Credit Cards?</b>
      Credit Cards is a mysterious slim rectangular shapped object which you can use to borrow money to pay for goods and services.
      On every card there is Credit max which allows the user to borrow this much money, along with
      the credit max there is also a minimum payment that follows every month to the card. If you do not pay this minimum payment towards this card it will start collecting interest
      and could lead to credit card debt. Moving on, there are also many different type of credit cards that allow for different things.
      Make sure to get in contact with an financial advisor, one from a fiduciary is preferred.<br>

      <b>What is Annual Percentage Rate? (APR)</b>

      It is basically a yearly percentage of borrowing money, including interest and fees.
      Lower APR = less interest over time. One thing to note is that the lender must disclose the APR, if you do not see it anywhere when getting a loan make sure to ask.
